The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data is based on accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
## Files in this repository are:
1. README.md -- the current file you are reading
2. CodeBook.md -- codebook describing variables, the data and transformations
3. run_analysis.R

The following processes where followed in getting data ready for as the project objective
## Download data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
##Download metadata from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
## Unzip data
## Read through metadata for insight
##Activate important packages in R (dplyr & data.table)
##Prepare the run_analysis scripts
## Run source code:run_analysis
